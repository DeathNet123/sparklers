I'm a passionate security researcher with a keen focus on the Linux kernel. I earned my BSCS from Punjab University FCIT, where I delved into the world of computing. My academic journey culminated in a fascinating Final Year Project, where I explored the intricacies of Vulnerability Research and Exploit Development on the Android Kernel.

Currently, I contribute my skills and knowledge as a dedicated Security Researcher at Ebryx, where I immerse myself in the dynamic realm of cybersecurity. My professional journey has led me to specialize in low-level binary exploitation, a field that constantly challenges and excites me.

Beyond the realms of security, my interests extend to the very core of computing. I find joy in Operating System Development, where I get to witness the intricate dance of code and hardware. The ever-evolving landscape of Cyber Security continues to captivate my curiosity, pushing me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements.

But my intrigue doesn't stop there. I'm also fascinated by Quantum Computers, exploring the potential they hold for reshaping the future of computing. On a cosmic scale, I find solace in the profound mysteries of Cosmology, marveling at the vastness and intricacies of the universe.

In essence, I'm on a perpetual quest for knowledge and innovation, driven by a genuine passion for the intricacies of technology and the security challenges it present.
